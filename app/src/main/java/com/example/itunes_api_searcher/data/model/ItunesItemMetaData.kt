 * "longDescription":"In 1990, commissioned by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics, veteran music film director Robert Mugge and renowned music scholar Robert Palmer ventured deep into the heart of the North Mississippi Hill Country and Mississippi Delta to seek out the best rural blues acts currently working. Starting on Beale Street in Memphis, they headed south to the juke joints, lounges, front porches, and parlors of Holly Springs, Greenville, Clarksdale, Bentonia, and Lexington. Along the way, they visited celebrated landmarks and documented talented artists cut off from the mainstream of the recording industry. The resulting film expresses reverence for the rich musical history of the region, spotlighting local performers, soon to be world-renowned, thanks in large part to the film, and demonstrating how the blues continues to thrive in new generations of gifted musicians."},

 * "description":"I want to take you on a journey of what anger is and how to conquer it or use it for good. Everyone has their own beliefs about what anger is and if it's good or bad. For 20 years of my life, I lived in fear, and that caused me to feel angry about my life. I was hanging around angry people, and I felt like I had no control. I worked out that most people who are depressed have repressed anger inside, and that's why they feel that way. <br /><br />This audiobook will give you back the power and control. I teach you how to release your anger so you can start living more free and healthily. If you sometimes get angry, it doesn't mean there's something wrong with you; it simply means you have something in your past that keeps getting triggered. It can all change in a heartbeat, and I will show you how to make the change in this book. <br /><br />We need to understand that every emotion we experience from day to day is useful in some context. People look at depression and anger like they are bad to experience. If you find the higher purpose to why it's happening, your life will transform. Take my hand on this journey, and your anger will soon be resolved. <br /><br />Take action today."},

 * "description":"<i>Women Spies: A Novel of Remembrance of Mata Hari, Mary Bowser, Noor Inayat Khan, Nancy Wake and other Strong Women of History<\/i> is a historical fiction that uses the \"grandmother's chair\" method to recount the very real histories of famous and infamous female spies down through the ages. The story begins with Lannie (a fictitious character) watching a mysterious neighbor moving in next door. Her grandmother (also fictitious) collects stories about spies. As Lannie learns about famous female spies, so does the listener. The fictitious background is used as a vehicle for discussing each of the featured women, presenting various views, some of them opposing, that affect our perception of these women today. A <i>Forbes Magazine<\/i> article commented that women have always been uniquely suited to spying because they understand subtle messages delivered through body language, and because they understand how people interact. The article goes on to say that women are good at multitasking, as a rule, since it is often required for successfully running a home.

 * "description":"The Ottoman Empire was a strong world power for over 600 years beginning in the late 13th century. How did it rise from one man who was given charge of a small parcel of land to an empire that spanned three continents? Why did it begin to lose battle after battle, eventually reaching a point where it was beaten back by its enemies? Which sultans presented the empire with the tools for success and which destroyed the unity? What contributed to its demise? <br /><br />These questions and more will be answered through this book as the secrets of the Ottoman Empire are revealed. This book contains a description of the origins and basics about the population of citizens within the empire along with descriptions about each of the 36 emperors' personal rises and falls in their quest to better the empire. Additionally, the contributions the Ottomans made to their empire and beyond to other countries will be described along with the daily life of those within the palace and those without. Is there anything left today that came from the Ottoman Empire? Or did the Ottoman Empire simply disappear without a trace left to indicate it existed?"},

Throughout the book, I have sought to paint the picture of the scenes I describe, so that this is more than an academic treatise. This book is meant to be more of a movie; a movie that plays out in your head as you hear its vivid details, so that you can feel that you were there as it was happening. <br /><br />This is certainly a quick listen, but it is densely packed with information that so many historians tend to overlook. Lincoln's story is a gripping tale, from beginning to end. Given the massive nature of his accomplishments and the nearly six decades he lived, you might wonder how these words can adequately cover so much ground. This book will give you an excellent grasp of the man - as a son, as a younger brother, as a father, as a thinker, as a politician, and, of course, as our 16th president."},

Civil Rights, Women's Lib, Anti-War Drafts and changes in the educational system all characterized the times. Told from the point of view of some of those who lived in the central part of the United States, far from the conflict and even decently distant from the unrest in urban centers, it is an effort to portray both the uncertainty and the wonder as exploration of space both within and without was mood of the times. <br /><br />Such a work cannot replace the experience of living through those times. And, no doubt, since any writer must pick and choose between events that occur in such times, there are things that have been left out of this account. However, it can serve as a springboard for those who wish to explore this recent history and it places a variety of sources into a coherent timeline of events and changes. It is not limited to conflict, but also embraces advances spurred on by the rivalry between the United States and Soviet Russia. Landmark changes occurred in the United States legal system, as well."},

Julius Caesar was a man who influenced the world in unparalleled ways, and his story is one loaded with an extravagant cast of politicians, generals, and royalty. It makes for a riveting tale of intrigue and melodrama. <br /><br />The audiobook begins with Caesar's early life, and the humble background from which he came. His accounts of great triumphs and great defeats are all included, as his exciting and eventful life is traced through the minutes of the book. Caesar was part of a time where record keeping was incredibly proficient, and the pieces we have to put together the life of this man and those around him are plentiful. Caesar's story is important down to the last detail, and this book encapsulates the details that matter, and help paint a picture of this legendary figure and the tumultuous time in which he lived. <br /><br />The greatest forms of entertainment can be found in the truth, rather than fiction, and Caesar's life is proof of this. It is history that tells us the most extravagant and unbelievable stories. No matter what amount of speculation or conjecture you throw into this story, the impact of Caesar's life is undeniable. His legacy is one that must be heard, and all that you could want to know about the man lies within this audiobook."},

 * "description":"John Adams didn't cut a dashing figure like George Washington. He was not the darling of France, as was Benjamin Franklin. He was not a wealthy and statuesque plantation owner like Thomas Jefferson. Adams was highly opinionated, blunt, and often tactless in his social interactions. To top it off, he was short, fat, and awkward. This does not sound like the description of a Founding Father we should want to know any better - but that's where you're wrong. <br /><br />Adams, perhaps more than any other Founding Father, was a driving force that pushed America to declare its independence from Britain. It was Adams who supplied the raw ideas of what a new government should look like. He always represented the larger public good in all of his public service, even when buffeted by the forces of antagonistic party politics during his tenure as the second president of the United States. The details and legacy of his life's work are best viewed through the lens of his relationships with people, places, and ideas. <br /><br />In <i>John Adams: Revealing Relationships of a Founding Father<\/i>, you will learn how Adams was frustrated with France, jostled by Jefferson, aided by Abigail and flummoxed by Franklin as well as how he masterminded his son's success in politics with Monroe and was often perplexed by politics."},

 * "description":"America's first African American heavyweight boxing champion, Jack Johnson, has a chance encounter with a mysterious Irishman, named Altamont, when they meet at the boxer's restaurant, Café de Champion, in August 1912. Johnson's new relationship with the unusual man, with beady eyes and hawk-like nose, places him in an unusual circumstance to help Altamont get out of a tough situation. <br /><br />In 1913, Johnson is nailed with a felony conviction in the American court system and flees to Canada, and later travels to England, to meet with fight promoters. But a stolen South African 'blood diamond' and a grudge harbored against the controversial boxer from the past, puts Johnson's life in peril while on British soil, reuniting him with the mysterious Altamont. Will Johnson uncover the true identity of this Irishman, and entrust his life to Altamont's care? <br /><br />And as the action unfurls, Johnson forms an alliance with a black British rogue and grifter, Steve Dixie, but can this man be trusted? With all the uncertainty Johnson faces in a foreign land, and for his own protection, he calls in a favor from his American Mafia cronies, finding himself in league with American teenage mobsters, Alphonse Capone, and Frankie Yale. Johnson, Altamont and their entourage of companions' race against the clock, not just to save Johnson's life, but to preserve the national security and future of Britain as well."},
